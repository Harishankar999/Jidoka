## Due to less problem statement i was not able to do the all part. I tried my level best to solve this problem.

## If You want to run my code first you have to clone my repo to your compiler after that :
## Step: 01
### npm install
## Step: 02
### cd backend (for go to backend file)
## Step: 03
### npm run start (It will start the server)
